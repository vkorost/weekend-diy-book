# About This Book

This book was written entirely by an AI. Not edited by one, not "assisted" by one — written by one. Claude Code, Anthropic's agentic coding tool, produced every chapter, following a detailed set of structural instructions and quality gates designed by Vladimir Korostyshevskiy.

The process worked like this: multiple AI systems — including Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity — were used to gather and research source material. They pulled from Anthropic's official Claude Code documentation, publicly available usage examples, technical analyses, and industry reports about agentic development practices. The usage examples were sourced with particular attention to sell-side and buy-side front office environments — trading UI development, order management systems, real-time data platforms, and the kind of mission-critical desktop and web applications that financial firms build and maintain under relentless delivery pressure. That raw research was then fed to Claude Code with an assignment file specifying the book's structure, voice, audience, deduplication rules, and legal constraints. Claude Code's multi-agent architecture did the rest — research agents read and summarized the sources in parallel, writer agents composed the chapters, editor agents reviewed them against quality criteria, and a final review panel checked for consistency, completeness, and compliance before the manuscript was assembled into the EPUB you're reading now.

No sentence in this book is copied from its source materials. Every idea has been paraphrased, synthesized, and rewritten. No company is mentioned by name other than Anthropic. No competing product is named. No individual is quoted or attributed. No URLs appear in the text. These constraints were deliberate — they make it possible to share this book freely without copyright concerns.

This book is not for beginners. If you've never used Claude Code, start with the official documentation. This book assumes you've been using the tool for months and want to get significantly better at it. It covers the mental models, advanced capabilities, practical patterns, and organizational strategies that separate casual users from people who are genuinely productive with agentic development tools.

The writing voice blends the narrative-driven explanations of Malcolm Gladwell with the direct, irreverent technical prose of Michael Lopp. If a paragraph reads like documentation, something went wrong. If it reads like a blog post that opens with "let's dive in," something went very wrong.

Every effort was made to ensure accuracy, but this is a book written by AI about a rapidly evolving AI tool. Some details may have changed between the time of writing and the time of reading. When in doubt, check the official Anthropic documentation for the current state of any feature or capability.

This book is free to share, distribute, and read. That was the whole point.
